# Major System Cleanup - Project Overview

**Status**: FAILED / ROLLED BACK  
**Classification**: MAJOR Feature  
**SEV Level**: SEV-0 (System stability threats)  
**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Final Outcome**: Complete baseline restoration to commit d8e2889

## TL;DR - Project Failure

The major system cleanup project attempted to consolidate Server-Sent Events (SSE) infrastructure and achieved a 94.4% code reduction, but resulted in **functional regression** where cross-tab synchronization (Active Stackers) broke completely. After multiple emergency fix attempts, debugging became harder rather than easier (violating project goals), leading to complete project failure and baseline restoration.

## Project Goal (Original)
- Consolidate SSE infrastructure to improve performance
- Make debugging SSE issues easier
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Reduce code duplication (achieved 94.4% reduction)

## Project Goal (Actual Result)
- ‚ùå Functional regression: Active Stackers cross-tab sync broken
- ‚ùå Debugging became harder, not easier
- ‚ùå Emergency fixes created 8+ parallel systems
- ‚ùå Server-side broadcasting worked, client-side consumption failed
- ‚úÖ Code consolidation achieved (but at cost of functionality)

*This project serves as a critical example of when consolidation efforts can break existing functionality and how emergency protocols should be applied to prevent scope creep during crisis response.*
