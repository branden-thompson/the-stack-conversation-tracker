# Dev Scripts Visual Polish - Requirements

**Feature**: Dev Scripts Visual Polish and Navigation Enhancement  
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Classification**: MINOR Feature  
**SEV Level**: SEV-3 (Low Impact/Low Complexity - UI/UX issues)

## Initial Problem Statement

User reported two critical issues with the dev-scripts interface:

1. **Navigation Clarity**: "Navigation for all the pages on index isn't obvious"
2. **Visual Polish**: "too close the browser edges - no appropriate border of visual distinction of the human user"
3. **Spacing Issues**: "visual polish and test pages have some vertical spacing (gutter) issues between the various sections"

## Core Requirements

### 1. Navigation Enhancement
- Make clickable vs non-clickable tool cards visually obvious
- Clear indication of interactive elements
- Consistent navigation patterns across all pages

### 2. Visual Polish Framework
- Implement proper container structure with margins/padding
- Add visual distinction from browser edges
- Create professional appearance with appropriate spacing
- Maintain zero-dependency lightweight CSS approach

### 3. Layout Consistency
- Fix vertical spacing/gutter issues between sections
- Ensure consistent grid layouts across all pages
- Maintain responsive design across screen sizes

### 4. Link Management
- Convert all relative links to absolute paths
- Ensure navigation works correctly across all dev-scripts pages
- Fix broken navigation links

## Technical Constraints

- **Zero Dependencies**: Must maintain pure HTML/CSS/vanilla JS approach
- **Development Only**: Security requirement - only accessible in development builds
- **Existing Compatibility**: Cannot break existing dev-scripts functionality
- **Mobile Responsive**: Must work across all device sizes

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Clear visual distinction between clickable and disabled tool cards
2. ✅ Professional container structure with proper margins
3. ✅ Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy across all pages
4. ✅ All navigation links working with absolute paths
5. ✅ Zero broken layouts or visual bugs
6. ✅ Maintained development-only security restrictions

## User Acceptance

- User confirmed: "looks good" after all fixes implemented
- No additional visual or navigation issues reported
- Ready to proceed to PDSOP phase
