# User Theme Mode Isolation - Requirements

**Feature**: User Theme Mode Isolation (Light/Dark/System per user)  
**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Classification**: MINOR Feature  
**SEV Level**: SEV-0 (Massive Impact/Extreme Complexity - System stability threats)

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue**: Theme mode selection (Light/Dark/System) is shared globally across all users on the same computer via `next-themes` localStorage, breaking user isolation.

**Specific Problem**:
- User A selects "Light mode" → affects User B in different tab
- Guest users share mode preferences when they should be isolated  
- Multi-tab testing shows immediate cross-user theme conflicts
- Violates core user isolation principle established for color themes

## Core Requirements

### 1. Theme Mode Per-User Isolation ✅
- Each user (guest/registered) has independent Light/Dark/System preference
- Mode changes only affect the user who made the selection
- Cross-tab/window isolation maintained within same browser session

### 2. Default Dark Mode for New Guests ✅  
- All new guest users default to Dark mode (per user request)
- Provisioned guests start with dark mode preference
- System users maintain their existing preferences

### 3. User Switching Theme Restoration ✅
- Switching between users restores each user's mode preference
- Theme mode persistence per user in appropriate storage layer
- Seamless transition without UI flicker or delays

### 4. SSE System Preservation ✅
- Theme mode changes MUST NOT disrupt SSE connections
- SSE events continue to flow during theme transitions
- No interference with existing SSE infrastructure

### 5. Optional Cross-Tab Synchronization ✅
- Same user's theme changes sync across multiple tabs/windows
- SSE events for theme coordination (optional enhancement)
- Preserves user experience in multi-tab workflows

## Technical Constraints

### Critical Constraints:
- **NOTHING CAN BREAK**: Especially SSE system must remain stable
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing user preferences must be preserved  
- **Performance**: No noticeable delay in theme switching
- **next-themes Integration**: Must work within existing theme architecture

### Architecture Constraints:
- Must integrate with existing `DynamicThemeProvider` for color themes
- Preserve `ThemeToggle` component interface and behavior
- Support both guest and registered user preference persistence
- Work within Next.js 15 and current provider structure

## Success Criteria

### User Experience:
1. ✅ User A selects "Light" → only User A sees light mode  
2. ✅ User B selects "Dark" → only User B sees dark mode
3. ✅ Switching users restores individual theme mode preferences
4. ✅ New guests default to Dark mode
5. ✅ Multi-tab testing shows proper isolation

### Technical Validation:
1. ✅ SSE connections remain stable during theme changes
2. ✅ No localStorage conflicts between users
3. ✅ Theme persistence works for both guest and registered users
4. ✅ Performance: Theme switching < 100ms response time
5. ✅ No breaking changes to existing components

### System Integration:
1. ✅ Works with existing user management system
2. ✅ Integrates with current SSE infrastructure  
3. ✅ Compatible with React Query optimizations
4. ✅ Supports future authenticated user preferences
5. ✅ Maintains dev/prod environment compatibility

## Risk Mitigation Requirements

### SEV-0 Risk Controls:
- **Pre-flight Testing**: Comprehensive SSE stability testing
- **Rollback Plan**: Instant rollback if SSE disruption detected
- **Feature Flags**: Ability to disable feature without system restart
- **Monitoring**: Theme change performance and SSE connection metrics

### Data Safety:
- **Preference Preservation**: Existing user themes must not be lost
- **Guest Session Integrity**: Guest isolation must be maintained
- **Storage Cleanup**: Prevent localStorage bloat from user theme data

## User Acceptance Criteria

**Testing Scenarios:**
1. **Multi-User Tab Testing**: Open 2+ tabs, different users, verify theme isolation
2. **User Switching**: Change theme → switch user → switch back → verify restoration
3. **Guest Provisioning**: Create new guest → verify dark mode default
4. **SSE Stability**: Monitor SSE connections during rapid theme switching
5. **Cross-Tab Sync**: Same user in multiple tabs → verify theme sync (if implemented)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Theme switching: Visual change within 100ms
- User switching: Theme restoration within 200ms  
- SSE preservation: Zero connection drops during theme changes
- Memory impact: < 1MB additional localStorage usage
