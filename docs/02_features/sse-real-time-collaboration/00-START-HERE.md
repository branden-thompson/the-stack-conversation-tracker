# SSE Real-Time Collaboration - SEV-0 Feature Implementation

**CLASSIFICATION**: **APPLICATION LEVEL** | LEVEL-1 | SEV-0 | EXTREMELY HIGH RISK  
**SCOPE**: System-level implications for core data synchronization architecture  
**STATUS**: AN-SOP Phase - Requirements Analysis  
**ZERO TOLERANCE**: Requirement Violations | Protocol Violations  

## 🚨 SEV-0 ALERT NOTICE

This implementation involves **complete replacement of core data synchronization architecture** with **zero downtime tolerance** and **zero data loss acceptance**. Any deviation from established protocols will result in **immediate escalation**.

## 📋 Feature Overview

**Objective**: Convert all Events/Actions to leverage SSE (Hub and Spoke) to completely eliminate polling and consolidate parallel data event emission tracking systems.

**Hypothesis**: Consolidating to single hub-and-spoke or pub/sub system will:
- Simplify architecture 
- Prepare for high performance with 5-30 users
- Eliminate performance degradations

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### LEVEL-1 Validation Requirements
- **User Approval Required**: Before proceeding to PLAN-SOP
- **Architecture Review**: All design decisions must be validated
- **Safety Controls**: Circuit breakers and emergency rollback required
- **Zero Downtime**: Implementation must maintain service availability

### SEV-0 Enhanced Monitoring
- **Real-time Performance Tracking**: Sub-100ms response time monitoring
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Continuous consistency checks
- **Emergency Procedures**: Immediate rollback capabilities
- **Resource Protection**: Memory and CPU usage monitoring

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Complete Polling Elimination**: No React Query polling for real-time data
2. **Event System Consolidation**: Single hub-and-spoke architecture
3. **Performance Target**: Support 5-30 concurrent users with no degradation
4. **Zero Data Loss**: All events properly propagated and persisted
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful degradation if SSE unavailable
