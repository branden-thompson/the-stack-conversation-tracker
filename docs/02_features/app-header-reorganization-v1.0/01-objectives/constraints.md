## üéØ CONSTRAINT MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test components incrementally
- **Fallback Patterns**: Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing of new functionality
- **Code Review**: Multiple review cycles before production deployment

### Business Risk Mitigation
- **User Testing**: Validate changes with representative users
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to quickly revert changes if issues arise
- **Phased Deployment**: Consider staged rollout if feasible
- **Communication Plan**: Clear communication of changes to stakeholders
