# Security Review Checklist - Conversation Tracker

## Overview
Security review checklist for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in the conversation-tracker application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- [ ] Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- [ ] Session tokens are cryptographically secure and random
- [ ] Session timeout is implemented appropriately
- [ ] Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- [ ] Account lockout mechanisms prevent brute force attacks
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication considered for sensitive operations

### Authorization
- [ ] Access controls enforce principle of least privilege
- [ ] User permissions are validated on server-side
- [ ] Guest users have appropriate restrictions
- [ ] Admin functions require elevated permissions
- [ ] API endpoints validate user authorization
- [ ] Cross-user data access is prevented

## Input Validation & Data Security

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated on both client and server
- [ ] Input length limits are enforced
- [ ] Special characters are handled safely
- [ ] File uploads (if any) are restricted and validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures in place
- [ ] NoSQL injection prevention for database queries

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or error messages
- [ ] User passwords are never stored in plain text
- [ ] API keys and secrets are not hardcoded
- [ ] Environment variables used for sensitive configuration

## Web Security

### XSS Prevention
- [ ] User-generated content is properly escaped/sanitized
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implemented
- [ ] React JSX prevents XSS by default (verified)
- [ ] Dynamic HTML generation is avoided or secured
- [ ] User profile data is sanitized before display

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] CSRF tokens implemented for state-changing operations
- [ ] SameSite cookie attributes configured correctly
- [ ] Origin/Referer validation for sensitive requests
- [ ] Double-submit cookie pattern used where appropriate

### Security Headers
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (if applicable)
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy configured appropriately

## API Security

### API Endpoints
- [ ] All API endpoints require appropriate authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- [ ] API versioning strategy prevents breaking changes
- [ ] Error responses don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] CORS configuration is restrictive and appropriate
- [ ] API documentation doesn't expose internal details

### Data Handling
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] User data is validated before database operations
- [ ] Bulk operations have appropriate limits
- [ ] Data export features have access controls
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Session Management

### Session Security
- [ ] Session IDs are unpredictable and random
- [ ] Sessions expire after appropriate time periods
- [ ] Session fixation attacks prevented
- [ ] Concurrent session limits (if required)
- [ ] Secure session storage mechanisms

### Browser Storage
- [ ] Sensitive data not stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
- [ ] Cookies have Secure and HttpOnly flags
- [ ] SameSite cookie attribute configured
- [ ] Session data encrypted if stored client-side

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Configuration
- [ ] Server software is up-to-date
- [ ] Unnecessary services are disabled
- [ ] Default credentials changed
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system details

### Database Security
- [ ] Database access uses least-privilege accounts
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Regular database backups with access controls
- [ ] Database audit logging enabled
- [ ] Default database passwords changed

## Conversation Tracker Specific

### Real-Time Features (SSE)
- [ ] SSE connections authenticated appropriately
- [ ] Real-time data includes proper access controls
- [ ] Cross-user event broadcasting prevented
- [ ] SSE endpoint rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Connection hijacking protection

### User Management
- [ ] User switching validates permissions
- [ ] Guest user data isolation
- [ ] Profile picture uploads are secure (if implemented)
- [ ] User preference changes validated
- [ ] User deletion handles data cleanup securely

### Theme System
- [ ] Custom theme data validated and sanitized
- [ ] Theme-related XSS vectors eliminated
- [ ] User theme preferences don't leak sensitive data
- [ ] Theme sharing (if implemented) has access controls

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Static code analysis for security issues
- [ ] SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools
- [ ] Container/infrastructure security scanning

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Authorization escalation testing
- [ ] Input validation boundary testing
- [ ] Session management testing
- [ ] Business logic security testing

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] Security incident response plan documented
- [ ] Log monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security contact information available
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Detection & Response
- [ ] Unusual activity monitoring
- [ ] Automated alerting for security events
- [ ] Log retention policies implemented
- [ ] Forensic logging capabilities

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Privacy
- [ ] User consent mechanisms (if required)
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Right to data deletion (if applicable)
- [ ] Privacy policy accuracy
- [ ] Data minimization principles followed

### Security Standards
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Security headers best practices
- [ ] Cryptographic standards compliance
- [ ] Secure coding practices followed
