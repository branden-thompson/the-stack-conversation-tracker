# Performance Review Checklist - Conversation Tracker

## Overview
Performance review checklist for identifying and preventing performance regressions in the conversation-tracker application.

## Frontend Performance

### React/Next.js Optimization
- [ ] Components use React.memo() where appropriate
- [ ] useCallback() and useMemo() used for expensive operations
- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders minimized
- [ ] Component tree depth is reasonable

- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for non-critical components

### Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Bundle size impact analyzed for new dependencies
- [ ] Code splitting implemented for large features
- [ ] Dynamic imports used for non-critical code
- [ ] Tree shaking eliminates unused code
- [ ] Dead code removal verified
- [ ] Webpack bundle analyzer used to identify bloat

### Asset Optimization
- [ ] Images are properly optimized and sized
- [ ] SVG icons used instead of image files where possible
- [ ] CSS is minified and optimized
- [ ] Unused CSS eliminated
- [ ] Critical CSS inlined for above-the-fold content
- [ ] Asset caching headers configured appropriately

### Runtime Performance
- [ ] No memory leaks in component lifecycles
- [ ] Event listeners properly cleaned up
- [ ] Timers and intervals cleared appropriately
- [ ] Heavy computations don't block UI thread

- [ ] Browser DevTools profiling shows no issues

## Backend Performance

### API Optimization
- [ ] Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] N+1 query problems eliminated

- [ ] Response caching used where appropriate
- [ ] Unnecessary data not included in responses
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured

### Server-Side Rendering
- [ ] SSR pages load within acceptable time limits
- [ ] Static generation used where possible
- [ ] Incremental Static Regeneration configured appropriately
- [ ] Server-side data fetching is optimized
- [ ] Hydration mismatches avoided

### Caching Strategy
- [ ] HTTP caching headers set appropriately
- [ ] Redis/memory caching used for expensive operations
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy implemented
- [ ] CDN integration for static assets (if applicable)
- [ ] Browser caching optimized for assets

## Database Performance

### Query Optimization
- [ ] Complex queries use appropriate indexes
- [ ] Query execution plans analyzed
- [ ] Slow query logging enabled and monitored
- [ ] Database constraints prevent performance issues
- [ ] Bulk operations use batch processing
- [ ] Connection pooling configured properly

### Data Structure
- [ ] Database schema normalized appropriately
- [ ] Foreign keys and indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Large text fields stored efficiently
- [ ] Data archiving strategy for historical data
- [ ] Database migrations don't cause downtime

## Real-Time Performance (SSE)

### Connection Management
- [ ] SSE connections don't accumulate memory leaks
- [ ] Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
- [ ] Heartbeat/keep-alive mechanism efficient
- [ ] Connection cleanup on client disconnect
- [ ] Graceful degradation when connections fail

### Event Processing
- [ ] Event broadcasting doesn't cause performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Event queue management prevents memory buildup
- [ ] Event filtering reduces unnecessary network traffic
- [ ] Batch event processing where appropriate
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents event flooding

### Multi-Tab Synchronization
- [ ] Tab synchronization doesn't cause exponential overhead
- [ ] Local storage operations are efficient
- [ ] Cross-tab communication optimized
- [ ] Duplicate event handling prevented
- [ ] Memory usage scales reasonably with open tabs

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- [ ] API endpoints tested under realistic load
- [ ] Database performance under concurrent access
- [ ] SSE connections tested with multiple clients
- [ ] Memory usage monitored under sustained load
- [ ] Response times measured and acceptable

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM) configured
- [ ] Key performance metrics tracked
- [ ] Performance alerts configured
- [ ] Regular performance regression testing
- [ ] Performance budgets defined and enforced

### Browser Performance
- [ ] Page load times measured and acceptable
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP) optimized
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) optimized  
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID) minimized
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) minimized
- [ ] Core Web Vitals meet Google recommendations

## Conversation Tracker Specific

### Theme System Performance
- [ ] Theme switching doesn't cause performance issues
- [ ] CSS-in-JS performance impact minimized
- [ ] Theme calculations cached appropriately
- [ ] Multiple theme loads don't degrade performance

### User Management Performance
- [ ] User switching operations are fast
- [ ] User data loading doesn't block UI
- [ ] Guest user operations optimized
- [ ] User preference updates are efficient

### Development Tools Performance
- [ ] Dev pages load efficiently
- [ ] Test result processing doesn't block UI
- [ ] Coverage data generation is reasonable
- [ ] Development scripts don't impact production

## Performance Budgets

### Page Load Performance
- [ ] Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 5 seconds
- [ ] Bundle size increase < 10% for new features
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for typical requests
- [ ] Database queries < 100ms for simple operations

### Resource Utilization
- [ ] Memory usage growth < 5MB for new features
- [ ] CPU usage doesn't spike during normal operations
- [ ] Network requests minimized
- [ ] Local storage usage remains reasonable

## Performance Regression Prevention

### Automated Checks
- [ ] Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
- [ ] Performance tests in deployment pipeline
- [ ] Lighthouse CI integration
- [ ] Database query performance monitoring
- [ ] Memory leak detection in tests

### Manual Validation
- [ ] Performance impact assessed for major changes
- [ ] Browser DevTools profiling for complex features
- [ ] Real device testing for mobile performance
- [ ] Network throttling testing
- [ ] Performance comparison before/after changes
