# OPSCHECK Procedures - Operational Compliance Check

**Purpose**: Comprehensive protocol compliance verification for APPLICATION LEVEL-1 SEV-0 projects  
**Created**: 2025-08-20  
**Authority**: Mandatory for all APPLICATION-LEVEL SEV-0 work  
**Derivation**: Major-system-cleanup failure analysis and enhanced development protocols

## OPSCHECK Definition

**OPSCHECK**: **Operational Compliance Check** - Systematic verification that all required protocols, structures, and safety measures are in place and compliant before proceeding with any APPLICATION LEVEL-1 SEV-0 project work.

### When to Execute OPSCHECK
- **Before AN-SOP**: Prior to beginning Analysis Standard Operating Procedures
- **Before PLAN-SOP**: Prior to beginning Planning Standard Operating Procedures  
- **Before DEV-SOP**: Prior to beginning Development Standard Operating Procedures
- **Before Mini-Projects**: Prior to each DEV-SOP mini-project phase
- **After Emergency Halt**: When resuming after crisis response
- **Context Restoration**: When Claude/agents reconnect to ongoing project

## OPSCHECK Compliance Matrix

### üîí **Git Strategy Compliance**
- [ ] **Mandatory Branch Created**: Dedicated branch for all work
- [ ] **Branch Naming Convention**: Follows established patterns
- [ ] **Main Branch Protection**: No direct commits to main
- [ ] **Incremental Commit Strategy**: Ready for mini-project checkpoints

### üìã **Documentation Structure Compliance**
- [ ] **Correct Location**: `/docs/01_application/{project-name}/` for APPLICATION-LEVEL
- [ ] **6-Folder Structure**: Complete 1-requirements through 6-key_learnings
- [ ] **00-START-HERE Navigation**: Present with current status and navigation
- [ ] **Standards Reference**: Links to `/docs/00_standards_and_practices/`
- [ ] **Archive Planning**: Failure handling and documentation preservation planned

### üéØ **Classification Compliance**
- [ ] **APPLICATION-LEVEL Verification**: Project affects project-wide standards/infrastructure
- [ ] **LEVEL-1 Validation**: Full phase safety checks and approval gates declared
- [ ] **SEV-0 Classification**: System stability threats properly identified
- [ ] **Enhanced Protocols**: All major-system-cleanup learnings integrated and active

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Phase Management Compliance**
- [ ] **Current Phase Identification**: Clear phase status (AN-SOP, PLAN-SOP, DEV-SOP)
- [ ] **Approval Gate Structure**: GO/NO-GO decision points defined
- [ ] **Mini-Project Planning**: DEV-SOP phases designed as independent mini-projects
- [ ] **Individual Phase Testing**: Each mini-project phase validation requirements defined

### üö® **Safety Protocol Compliance**
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Active**: 3+ failed attempts = automatic rollback consideration
- [ ] **Emergency Procedures Ready**: User directive compliance protocols active
- [ ] **SSE Special Handling**: Additional protocols for any SSE-related work
- [ ] **Rollback Planning**: Complete restoration procedures documented and ready

### üìä **Enhanced Protocol Compliance** (APPLICATION-LEVEL Specific)
- [ ] **Mini-Project Structure**: DEV-SOP phases designed as independent mini-projects
- [ ] **Checkpoint Commits**: Commit strategy after each mini-project completion
- [ ] **Phase GO/NO-GO Gates**: Individual decision points per implementation area
- [ ] **Application Clean State**: Strategy to maintain clean state throughout

## OPSCHECK Execution Process

### 1. Pre-Check Preparation
- Identify current project phase and requirements
- Gather all relevant documentation references
- Verify access to all required standards and procedures
- Confirm project classification and protocol requirements

### 2. Systematic Compliance Check
- Execute each checklist item systematically
- Document any non-compliance items discovered
- Assess severity of any compliance gaps
- Determine corrective actions required

### 3. Compliance Resolution
- **Full Compliance**: Proceed with planned work
- **Minor Issues**: Correct immediately and re-check
- **Major Issues**: Halt work, address compliance gaps, restart OPSCHECK
- **Critical Issues**: Escalate to emergency procedures

### 4. OPSCHECK Documentation
- Document OPSCHECK completion in project 1-requirements folder
- Record any issues found and corrective actions taken
- Update project status with OPSCHECK completion
- Prepare for next phase with compliance verification complete

## OPSCHECK Integration with Memory Instructions

### Claude Code Memory Integration
**New Protocol Term**: **OPSCHECK** must be integrated into all Claude Code memory and documentation:

1. **Before Phase Work**: Always execute OPSCHECK before beginning any APPLICATION LEVEL-1 SEV-0 phase
2. **Protocol Verification**: Systematic compliance check, not optional
3. **Documentation Requirement**: OPSCHECK results documented in project requirements
4. **Memory Instructions**: Update all relevant memory with OPSCHECK procedures

### Memory Instruction Updates Required
- **Global CLAUDE.md**: Add OPSCHECK as mandatory step for APPLICATION-LEVEL work
- **Project Documentation**: Include OPSCHECK requirements in all APPLICATION-LEVEL projects
- **Standards References**: OPSCHECK procedures referenced in all relevant standards
- **Agent Instructions**: AI agents must execute OPSCHECK before APPLICATION-LEVEL work

## OPSCHECK Failure Response

### Compliance Failures
- **Immediate**: Stop all current work
- **Assessment**: Document compliance gaps
- **Resolution**: Address all issues before proceeding
- **Re-Check**: Complete OPSCHECK again after corrections

### Emergency OPSCHECK
During crisis situations, abbreviated OPSCHECK focused on:
- Critical safety protocols
- Essential documentation
- Minimum viable compliance
- Post-crisis full OPSCHECK required

## OPSCHECK Continuous Improvement

### Learning Integration
- Incorporate OPSCHECK failures into standards updates
- Refine checklist based on real project experience
- Update procedures based on new protocol learnings
- Regular review of OPSCHECK effectiveness

### Standards Evolution
- OPSCHECK procedures evolve with development standards
- New learnings from project failures integrated
- Protocol effectiveness measured and improved
- Team feedback incorporated into procedures

---

**Authority**: OPSCHECK is mandatory for all APPLICATION LEVEL-1 SEV-0 projects. Compliance is not optional and must be verified before proceeding with any phase work.

**Integration Requirement**: All Claude Code memory, documentation, and agent instructions must be updated to include OPSCHECK as a standard procedure.
