# Development Standards and Best Practices

**Purpose**: Project-wide development standards, patterns, and architectural guidelines  
**Derived From**: Major system cleanup failure analysis and successful project patterns  
**Scope**: All development work in the Conversation Tracker application

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Functional Preservation is Non-Negotiable
- **Working System > Clean Architecture** - Always prioritize functionality over code aesthetics
- **Regression Prevention** - Any change that breaks existing functionality is unacceptable
- **User Experience First** - Technical improvements must not degrade user experience
- **Rollback Readiness** - Every significant change must have a documented rollback plan

### 2. Real-Time Features Require Special Handling
- **SSE as Critical Infrastructure** - Server-Sent Events are core to application functionality
- **Cross-Tab Testing Mandatory** - All real-time changes must be tested across browser tabs
- **Client-Server Pipeline** - Success on server-side does not guarantee client-side success
- **Performance Impact Assessment** - Real-time features affect overall application performance

### 3. Architecture Change Recognition
- **Consolidation â‰  Simple Refactoring** - Combining systems is architectural work, not maintenance
- **Infrastructure Impact Assessment** - Changes affecting multiple features = application-level work
- **Scope Escalation Awareness** - Implementation may reveal greater complexity than initially apparent
- **Classification Accuracy** - Match development process to actual risk and complexity

## Project Classification Guidelines

### Application-Level Changes
**Recognition Criteria**:
- Affects project-wide standards or practices
- Touches real-time infrastructure (SSE, WebSockets)
- Modifies core user management or authentication
- Changes build system, deployment, or performance critical paths
- Impacts multiple features or cross-cutting concerns

**Development Requirements**:
- SEV-1 classification minimum
- **MANDATORY**: Work must occur in dedicated git branch
- Complete documentation structure (6-folder system)
- Comprehensive testing including cross-tab synchronization
- Rollback plan documented before implementation
- Post-implementation validation across all affected features
- Merge to main only after full verification

### Feature-Level Changes
**Recognition Criteria**:
- Scoped to individual features or components
- UI/UX improvements within existing functionality
- New features that don't affect existing systems
- Bug fixes with isolated impact

**Development Requirements**:
- SEV-2 or SEV-3 classification typically
- Feature-specific documentation and testing
- Integration testing with related components
- Standard code review and approval process

### Hygiene-Level Changes  
**Recognition Criteria**:
- Code cleanup and refactoring without functional changes
- Documentation updates and improvements
- Development tooling and process improvements
- Dependency updates and maintenance

**Development Requirements**:
- SEV-4 or SEV-5 classification
- Minimal approval process
- Focus on documentation and maintainability
- Verify no functional impact

## SSE Development Standards

### Mandatory Requirements for SSE Changes
1. **Classification**: SEV-1 minimum for any SSE modification
2. **Cross-Tab Testing**: Test synchronization across multiple browser tabs
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Measure impact on application performance  
4. **Rollback Plan**: Document restoration procedure before implementation
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Reference SSE troubleshooting framework

### SSE Change Categories
**High-Risk Changes** (SEV-0 or SEV-1):
- EventSource connection management modifications
- Event consumption pipeline changes
- Real-time feature architecture changes
- SSE server infrastructure updates
- Performance optimizations affecting event delivery

**Medium-Risk Changes** (SEV-1):  
- Individual event handler modifications
- Component subscription pattern updates
- Event payload structure changes
- Error handling improvements

**Lower-Risk Changes** (SEV-1 minimum):
- Logging and debugging enhancements
- Event filtering improvements
- Connection status monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

### SSE Testing Requirements
- **Multi-Tab Testing**: Open 2+ tabs, verify real-time synchronization
- **Connection Stability**: Test connection recovery and reconnection
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor resource usage and response times
- **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures and recovery
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verify EventSource support

## Code Quality Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between components
- **Dependency Injection** - Avoid tight coupling between systems
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Performance Consideration** - Monitor and optimize resource usage
- **Security Best Practices** - No secrets in code, secure data handling

### Component Development
- **Theme Awareness** - All UI components must support theme variations
- **Accessibility** - Follow WCAG guidelines for user accessibility
- **Responsive Design** - Components work across device sizes
- **Testing Coverage** - Unit tests for logic, integration tests for interactions
- **Documentation** - Clear documentation for component APIs

### Data Management
- **React Query Integration** - Use established query patterns for server state
- **Cache Management** - Proper cache invalidation and updates
- **State Management** - Clear patterns for local vs server state
- **Data Validation** - Client and server-side validation
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of data loading failures

## Git Branch Strategy

### Mandatory Branch Usage

#### MAJOR and APPLICATION-Level Projects
**Requirement**: **MANDATORY** - All work must occur in dedicated git branch  
**Rationale**: Protects main branch from experimental/high-risk changes  
**Process**:
1. Create descriptive branch before any implementation
2. Complete all development work in branch
3. Full verification and testing in branch
4. Merge to main only after complete validation
5. Delete branch after successful merge

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/descriptive-name`
- **Architecture Changes**: `arch/system-name-change`  
- **Infrastructure Work**: `infra/infrastructure-component`
- **Emergency Fixes**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Experimental Work**: `experiment/exploration-name`

**Examples**:
- `feature/sse-real-time-collaboration`
- `arch/theme-modularization`  
- `infra/performance-monitoring-system`
- `hotfix/cross-tab-sync-failure`
- `experiment/sse-consolidation-approach`

### Branch Protection Strategy

#### Main Branch Protection
- **Direct commits prohibited** for MAJOR/APPLICATION work
- **Merge requirements**: Full verification completed in branch
- **Testing requirements**: All tests passing in branch
- **Documentation requirements**: Complete documentation in branch

#### Branch Verification Requirements
**Before Merge to Main**:
1. **Functional Testing**: All features working as expected
2. **Cross-Tab Testing**: Real-time features synchronized (if applicable)
3. **Integration Testing**: No regression in existing functionality  
4. **Performance Testing**: No significant performance degradation
5. **Documentation Complete**: All required documentation updated
6. **Rollback Plan Tested**: Verify rollback procedures work

### Emergency Branch Procedures

#### Crisis Situations
- **Emergency branches allowed** for critical fixes
- **Accelerated merge process** with immediate post-merge verification
- **Documentation requirement**: Can be completed post-merge for true emergencies
- **Post-crisis review**: Full analysis of emergency branch usage

#### Failed Branch Handling
- **Preserve failed work**: Keep branch for analysis
- **Archive documentation**: Move analysis to `/docs/06_archive/`
- **Learning extraction**: Incorporate insights into standards
- **Clean slate**: Return to main branch for fresh approach

### Branch Workflow Examples

#### Successful MAJOR Project
```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout -b feature/major-feature-name

# 2. Development work (multiple commits)
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial implementation"
git add -A && git commit -m "Add safety controls"
git add -A && git commit -m "Complete testing"

# 3. Final verification
# - Test all functionality
# - Verify cross-tab sync (if applicable)
# - Confirm no regressions
# - Complete documentation

# 4. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/major-feature-name
git branch -d feature/major-feature-name
```

#### Failed Project Recovery
```bash
# 1. Preserve failed work
git checkout -b archive/failed-project-name

# 2. Return to main
git checkout main

# 3. Clean state verification
# - Test all functionality works
# - Verify no remnants of failed work

# 4. Document failure (branch preserved for analysis)
```
