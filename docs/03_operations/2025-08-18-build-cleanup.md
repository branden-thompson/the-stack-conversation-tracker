# Build Cleanup and Docker Checkpoint Summary

## Date: 2025-08-18

### Objectives Completed ✅

1. **Fixed All Build Errors**
   - Fixed missing `testHistory` data in `/dev/tests` page
   - Created proper coverage data structure

2. **Fixed Next.js 15 Warnings**
   - Updated all API routes to use async `params` correctly
   - Changed from `params.id` to `const { id } = await params`
   - Applied to all dynamic routes in `/api/conversations/[id]/*` and `/api/sessions/[id]/*`

3. **Fixed ESLint Warnings**
   - Resolved anonymous default export warnings
   - Named exports in:
     - `lib/auth/guest-session.js`
     - `lib/services/conversation-session-bridge.js`
     - `lib/utils/clear-guest-data.js`

4. **Successfully Built Docker Container**
   - Used existing Docker configuration in `/docker/` directory
   - Container builds without errors
   - Application runs successfully on port 3000
   - Tested and verified working

### Build Status

```bash
✅ Build: SUCCESS
✅ Linting: PASS (with minor React hooks warnings)
✅ Docker Build: SUCCESS
✅ Docker Run: VERIFIED WORKING
```

### Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

Some React hooks dependency warnings remain but don't affect functionality:
- `useGuestUsers.js` - Missing dependencies in useEffect/useCallback
- `useHaxMode.js` - Unnecessary dependency
- `useSessionEmitter.js` - Missing dependency
- `useUserTracking.js` - Missing dependencies

These are lint warnings only and don't prevent the application from building or running.

### Docker Information

**Image:** `conversation-tracker:latest`
**Size:** ~200MB (optimized multi-stage build)
**Port:** 3000 (internal), configurable via docker-compose

### Commands for Future Use

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -f docker/dockerfile -t conversation-tracker:latest .

# Run Docker container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 conversation-tracker:latest

# Using docker-compose (from docker directory)
cd docker && docker-compose up
```

### Key Files Modified

1. `/data/coverage-data.js` - Added test coverage data
2. Multiple API routes - Fixed async params usage
3. Library files - Fixed ESLint warnings
4. `/CLAUDE.md` - Created memory file for future sessions

### Notes

- The application has a clean production build
- Docker container works as a checkpoint for the current state
- All critical errors and warnings have been resolved
- The codebase is now ready for deployment

*This represents a stable checkpoint of the application with all critical issues resolved.*
