# Main App Navigation Rename

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Objective
Update the main app navigation link name and icon to better represent the core functionality and future scalability.

## Problem
- **Before**: "Main App" with Home icon
- **Issues**: 
  - Generic name doesn't describe the functionality
  - "Main App" implies there's only one app page
  - We now have multiple app pages and will add more
  - Home icon doesn't represent the conversation board concept

## Solution
Renamed navigation to reflect the core conversation board functionality with an appropriate icon.

## Changes Made

### `/components/ui/left-tray.jsx`

**Import Update:**
```javascript
// Before
import { X, MessageSquare, TestTube, Home, BarChart3, History, Users } from 'lucide-react';

// After  
import { X, MessageSquare, TestTube, Layers, BarChart3, History, Users } from 'lucide-react';
```

**Navigation Link Update:**
```javascript
// Before
<Home className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
Main App

// After
<Layers className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
The Conversation Stack
```

## Benefits

### 1. Descriptive Naming
- **"The Conversation Stack"** clearly describes the core functionality
- Represents the layered, organized nature of conversation management
- Aligns with the application's main purpose

### 2. Future-Proof
- Doesn't imply it's the only app page
- Leaves room for additional app pages (timeline, analytics, etc.)
- Scales with the growing application ecosystem

### 3. Visual Consistency
- **Layers icon** better represents the "stack" concept
- More semantic than generic "Home" icon
- Visually communicates the layered conversation organization

### 4. Brand Alignment
- Matches the application name "The Stack"
- Reinforces the core conversation tracking concept
- Creates cohesive branding throughout the interface

## Navigation Context
Updated navigation now clearly distinguishes:
- **"The Conversation Stack"** → `/` (main conversation board)
- **"Card Tracking"** → `/dev/convos` (card events monitoring)
- **"User Tracking"** → `/dev/user-tracking` (user analytics)
- **"Timeline"** → `/timeline/*` (conversation history)

## Icon Choice Rationale
**Layers icon** was chosen because:
- Represents the concept of stacking/organizing
- Visually communicates layered information
- Common icon for organizational/structural concepts
- Maintains 4x4 size consistency with other navigation icons
