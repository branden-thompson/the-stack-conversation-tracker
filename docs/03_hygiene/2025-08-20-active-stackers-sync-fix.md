# Active Stackers Cross-Tab Synchronization Fix

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Classification**: DEV-SOP Phase 5 - Cross-tab Presence Sync Fix  
**Issue**: Active Stackers component not syncing user presence changes between browser tabs

## Problem Summary

The Active Stackers component was not synchronizing user presence updates between browser tabs. When a user switched identities in one tab, other tabs would not show the updated user list in real-time.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **SSE Connection Instability**: SSE connections were constantly closing and reconnecting due to dependency loops in `useSSEConnection` hook
2. **Rate Limiting**: Constant reconnections triggered server-side rate limiting (429 errors)  
3. **Duplicate SSE Connections**: Both `SSEEventConsumer` and `ActiveUsersDisplay` were creating separate SSE connections
4. **Event Handler Dependency Issues**: React useEffect dependency arrays included functions that were recreated on every render

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed SSE Connection Dependency Loop (`lib/hooks/useSSEConnection.js`)

**Problem**: `useEffect` dependency array included `createConnection` and `closeConnection` functions, which were recreated due to handler dependencies, causing infinite reconnection loops.

**Fix**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Caused dependency loops
useEffect(() => {
  // connection logic
}, [sseEnabled, user?.id, createConnection, closeConnection]);

// AFTER: Stable dependencies only
useEffect(() => {
  // connection logic  
}, [sseEnabled, user?.id]); // Removed function dependencies
```

### 2. Consolidated SSE Event Consumption

**Problem**: Multiple components creating separate SSE connections caused conflicts and instability.

**Fix**:
- Removed duplicate SSE connection code from `ActiveUsersDisplay` component
- Consolidated all SSE event handling through global `SSEEventConsumer` component
- `ActiveUsersDisplay` now relies solely on React Query cache updates triggered by the global SSE consumer

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- SSE connection establishment/closure
- Event broadcasting server-side
- Event consumption client-side
- React Query cache invalidation

## Verification Status

### ✅ **Server-Side Broadcasting Working**
```bash
# Test command verified broadcasting works
node dev-scripts/test-cross-tab-sync.js

# Server logs show successful broadcasting:
[SSE Manager] Broadcasting user joined: test_user_alpha
[SSE Manager] Broadcast user:joined to 2 users
[SSE Broadcast] Broadcasting user joined: test_user_alpha ✓
```

### ⚠️ **Client-Side Event Consumption** 
- Server-side broadcasting is confirmed working
- SSE connections are establishing without rate limiting
- Client-side event consumption logs not yet visible in dev server output
- Requires browser-based manual testing to confirm full end-to-end functionality

## Manual Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working completely:

1. **Open Multiple Browser Tabs**:
   ```
   Tab 1: http://localhost:3000/
   Tab 2: http://localhost:3000/
   ```

2. **Check Active Stackers Component**:
   - Look for "Active Stackers:" section in both tabs
   - Note the current user count and profile pictures

3. **Switch Users in One Tab**:
   - Use the user switcher to change to a different user
   - Watch for immediate updates in the other tab's Active Stackers display

4. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for `[SSE] User joined:` log messages
   - Verify React Query cache invalidation logs

5. **Monitor Dev Server Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for these patterns:
   [SSE Manager] Broadcasting user joined: <userId>
   [SSE] User joined: <userId> (<userName>)
   ```

## Technical Implementation Details

### SSE Event Flow
1. **User Switch Trigger**: User selects different identity in one browser tab
2. **Server Broadcast**: `GlobalSessionProvider` calls `/api/sse/broadcast/user-joined`
3. **SSE Manager**: Server broadcasts event to all connected SSE clients  
4. **Client Consumption**: `SSEEventConsumer` receives `user:joined` event via `useSSEConnection`
5. **Cache Update**: React Query sessions cache invalidated via `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
6. **UI Re-render**: All components using sessions data (including Active Stackers) automatically re-render

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/hooks/useSSEConnection.js` - Fixed dependency loops
- `components/ui/active-users-display.jsx` - Removed duplicate SSE code
- `components/ui/sse-event-consumer.jsx` - Enhanced debug logging
- `app/api/sse/broadcast/user-joined/route.js` - Server-side broadcasting endpoint

### Safety Controls
- Rate limiting protection for SSE connections
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts  
- Safety switches for enabling/disabling SSE functionality
- Connection attempt limits to prevent runaway connections

## Current Status

**✅ RESOLVED**: SSE connection stability issues  
**✅ RESOLVED**: Rate limiting problems  
**✅ RESOLVED**: Duplicate connection conflicts  
**⏳ PENDING**: Manual browser testing for complete end-to-end verification

The core technical issues have been resolved. The fix should work correctly, but requires manual browser testing to confirm complete functionality since client-side event logs are not appearing in the Node.js dev server output (they appear in browser console only).
