✅ SUCCESS: Created Card Events API endpoint (/api/cards/events) with debugging metadata
✅ SUCCESS: Implemented useSSECardEvents hook based on proven regular SSE pattern
✅ SUCCESS: Added special card-flip debugging with detailed event tracking
✅ SUCCESS: Ensured background operation support for dev/convos real-time requirements
✅ SUCCESS: Created comprehensive testing components and test page
✅ SUCCESS: Validated API endpoint functionality with card flip state changes
✅ SUCCESS: Configured 1000ms intervals for real-time feel, 800ms for dev pages
✅ SUCCESS: Integrated hook registry coordination to prevent conflicts
✅ SUCCESS: Added performance monitoring and debugging infrastructure

LEARNINGS: 
The key requirement for real-time card collaboration was achieving sub-second response times while maintaining system stability. By using the proven regular SSE pattern (avoiding the problematic optimized SSE infrastructure), we achieved 1-second intervals with comprehensive card-flip debugging. The critical insight was ensuring background operation continues in inactive tabs to support dev/convos real-time functionality, as this is essential for development workflow continuity.

The card-flip debugging implementation required special attention due to historical issues with 3D animations and state synchronization. We addressed this with enhanced metadata tracking, detailed event logging, separate performance counters for flip events, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. The solution provides the real-time collaboration capabilities needed while maintaining debuggability and system reliability.
