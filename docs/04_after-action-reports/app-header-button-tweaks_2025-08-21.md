LEARNINGS: 
BRTOPS v1.1.001 directive commands proved highly effective for scope management, preventing feature creep through clear boundary definition. The DIRECTIVE command successfully established persistent operational instructions equivalent to Claude '#' commands. Project's automated quality integration via post-commit hooks maintained dev page accuracy without manual intervention. Clean development startup script ensured single, isolated testing environment eliminating port conflicts and cross-tab synchronization issues.
