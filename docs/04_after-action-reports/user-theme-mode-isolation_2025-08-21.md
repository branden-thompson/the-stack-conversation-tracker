FINAL RESULT: SUCCESS 

TL;DR: Successfully implemented per-user theme mode isolation (Light/Dark/System) that prevents theme settings from being shared across different users on the same computer, while preserving SSE system stability and providing 5-layer safety architecture for production rollback.

 ✅ SUCCESS: Production build verification completed
 ✅ SUCCESS: Documentation structure completed (6-folder feature documentation)
 ✅ SUCCESS: Implementation summary and key learnings documented

LEARNINGS: 
The implementation successfully solved the core problem of theme mode isolation while discovering that next-themes has aggressive cross-tab synchronization that required localStorage interception to prevent global theme conflicts. The technical challenge was elegantly solved by wrapping next-themes with a user-aware provider and intercepting global localStorage writes to the 'theme' key. The 5-layer safety architecture (instant disable, environment toggle, provider bypass, hook fallback, full revert) provides confidence for production deployment. The SEV-0 classification was appropriate as this feature touches core user experience, and the safety-first approach prevented any disruption to the existing SSE system. Guest users defaulting to dark mode was implemented as requested and verified through testing.

NOTES AND ACTION ITEMS:
 • Feature is production-ready and tested across multiple browser tabs
 • Monitor localStorage key proliferation in production (normal for multi-user systems)
 • Consider periodic cleanup of abandoned guest theme modes in future maintenance
 • Test page at /dev/theme-isolation-test remains available for ongoing verification
 • Emergency rollback procedures documented and tested
 • SSE system stability confirmed - no breaking changes introduced
