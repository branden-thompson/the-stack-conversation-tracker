---- AFTER ACTION REPORT | SSE Hook Coordination Debugging ----
DATE: 2025-08-21
CONTRIBUTORS: Human User & Claude (AI Agent)
FINAL RESULT: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Hook coordination system working, optimized SSE hook still needs debugging

TL;DR: Successfully implemented hook coordination system and fixed multiple dev server issues. Regular SSE hook working correctly with safe intervals. Optimized SSE hook has deeper infrastructure issue requiring further investigation.

ACTIONS:
✅ SUCCESS: Created global SSE hook registry system
✅ SUCCESS: Implemented hook-based coordination to prevent duplicate execution
✅ SUCCESS: Fixed multiple dev server instance problem (root cause of initial API runaway)
✅ SUCCESS: Verified regular SSE hook respects 5000ms safe intervals
✅ SUCCESS: Fixed hardcoded 3000ms interval in useSSEIntegration
❌ FAILED: Optimized SSE hook still causes API runaway despite interval fixes
✅ SUCCESS: Added comprehensive debugging logging throughout SSE hooks
✅ SUCCESS: Established clean dev server startup procedures

LEARNINGS: 
The primary issue was **multiple dev server instances** running simultaneously on different ports (3000, 3001, 3002), not the hook coordination system itself. Each dev server was running independent SSE hooks, creating the illusion of coordination failure. The hook registry pattern works correctly when properly implemented. However, the optimized SSE hook has architectural issues deeper in the SSE infrastructure chain that bypass interval configuration.

The `useSSEIntegration` hook had a hardcoded 3000ms default that was overriding safe intervals, but fixing this didn't resolve the optimized hook's runaway behavior. The issue appears to be in the SSE infrastructure components that compose the optimized hook, suggesting multiple timers or polling mechanisms are active simultaneously within the infrastructure.

NOTES AND ACTION ITEMS:
- Regular SSE hook is stable and ready for Card Event Migration
- Hook coordination system prevents duplicate hooks when single server instance is running
- Optimized SSE hook needs deeper architectural investigation
- Multiple dev server detection and prevention should be documented as standard practice
- Clean dev startup script should be used consistently to prevent port conflicts

NEXT STEPS:
1. Deeper debugging of optimized SSE infrastructure components
2. Identify specific component causing interval bypass in optimized hook
3. Fix optimized SSE hook before Card Event Migration
4. Card Event Migration can proceed with regular SSE hook if optimized fix is complex
