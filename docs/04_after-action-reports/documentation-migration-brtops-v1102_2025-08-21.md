LEARNINGS: 
The conversation-tracker project already had strong documentation organization that aligned closely with BRTOPS principles, requiring minimal structural changes. The primary gaps were missing quality documentation folder and inconsistent naming conventions. BRTOPS v1.1.002 universal structure provides excellent framework for maintaining documentation consistency across projects of different scales and types.

The migration demonstrated that existing well-organized projects can be adapted to BRTOPS standards without disrupting established workflows. The addition of formal quality documentation structure enhances project governance while the standardized folder hierarchy improves navigation and discoverability for both human team members and AI agents.
