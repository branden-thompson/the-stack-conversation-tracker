# System Analysis and Cleanup - Project Requirements and Scope

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Project**: system-analysis-and-cleanup  
**Classification**: APPLICATION-LEVEL | LEVEL-1 | SEV-0  
**Requestor**: Branden Thompson  
**Phase**: Requirements Documentation

## Original Project Request

### User Statement
> "We're gonna try this again with our updated practices:
> 
> NEW APPLICATION-LEVEL Clean Up Project
> 'system-analysis-and-cleanup'
> LEVEL-1 | SEV-0 | All PROTOCOL ENHANCEMENTS IN EFFECT"

### Context and Motivation
User identified regression concerns after baseline restoration:
> "I'm noticing some SSR things don't seem to work, but I can no longer tell if that's because of where we re-baselined."

### Enhanced Protocol Requirements
> "Adhere to all level-1 sev-0 protocols
> Present plans prior to a GO/NOGO for DEV-SOP
> DEV-SOP and subsequent phases of this project not guaranteed; will depend on plans presented
> Respect all documentation protocols; even NOGO will result in documentation being preserved and archived"

**Requirement**: "Evaluate the entire project to look for places the architecture can be cleaned up and modularized"  
- **Scope**: System-wide architecture assessment
- **Objective**: Identify consolidation and cleanup opportunities
- **Success Criteria**: Concrete recommendations for architectural improvements

### 3. Pattern Extraction and Modularization
**Requirement**: "Evaluate repeating patterns that can be extracted and modularized"
- **Scope**: Codebase-wide pattern analysis
- **Objective**: Reduce code duplication through pattern extraction
- **Success Criteria**: Identified patterns with extraction strategies and impact assessment

### 4. Design System Integration
**Requirement**: "Evaluate all parts of the UI to now leverage lib/design-system/ including base components using tailwind or shadCN defaults"
- **Scope**: Complete UI component migration to design system
- **Objective**: Standardize theming and component patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Migration strategy for moving from legacy themes to design system

### 5. Testing Infrastructure Enhancement
**Requirement**: "Evaluate our testing infrastructure to help ensure we get immediate feedback on regressions, particularly in any areas using SSE"
- **Scope**: Testing framework assessment with SSE focus
- **Objective**: Prevent regression failures like major-system-cleanup
- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive testing strategy especially for real-time features

### 6. SSE Preparation
**Requirement**: "Prepare for a follow up system-level level-1 sev-0 project for sse-simplification-and-cleanup"
- **Scope**: Foundation work for future SSE cleanup
- **Objective**: Enable future SSE simplification project
- **Success Criteria**: Documented preparation work and architectural foundation

## Architecture Review Objectives (User Clarification)

### Core Objectives
> "Do a thorough architecture review to determine how we can simplify
> -> While preserving all existing and/or intended functionality
> -> significantly streamline debugging and troubleshooting  
> -> Enforce our Development Practice and Project Management protocols
> -> Preserve contextual checkpoints for Claude and other agents in event of context overrun or session disconnect"

### Functional Preservation Requirement
**Critical Constraint**: All existing and intended functionality MUST be preserved
- **Non-Negotiable**: No functionality regression acceptable
- **Reference**: Major-system-cleanup failure due to functional regression
- **Validation**: Comprehensive testing required before any changes

### Debugging and Troubleshooting Enhancement
**Objective**: Make system debugging significantly easier
- **Current State**: Complex troubleshooting after major-system-cleanup
- **Target State**: Streamlined debugging processes
- **Approach**: Simplify without losing necessary complexity

### Protocol Enforcement
**Objective**: Enforce Development Practice and Project Management protocols
- **Reference**: Enhanced protocols from major-system-cleanup learnings
- **Integration**: OPSCHECK procedures, git branch strategy, SEV classification
- **Validation**: Protocol compliance throughout implementation

### Agent Context Preservation
**Objective**: Maintain contextual checkpoints for AI agents
- **Use Case**: Context overrun or session disconnect scenarios
- **Requirement**: Clear documentation and decision points
- **Implementation**: Enhanced documentation with agent-specific guidance

## Enhanced Protocol Requirements

### APPLICATION-LEVEL Special Protocols
Based on user clarification of APPLICATION-LEVEL project requirements:

#### Mini-Project Structure
**Requirement**: "APPLICATION LEVEL PROJECTS should treat each DEV-SOP phase as a 'mini-project' within the larger group in terms of testing/documentation and commit-to-the-branch checkpoints"

#### Individual Phase Gates
**Requirement**: "each DEV-SOP phase (area or domain of implementation) has its own check point of Go/No-Go"

#### Clean State Maintenance  
**Requirement**: "This makes it important to carefully consider how each phase of DEV-SOP should be chunked so they can be committed incrementally and keep the application in a good, clean state"

### Documentation Structure Requirements
- **Location**: `/docs/01_application/system-analysis-and-cleanup/` (corrected from initial `/docs/02_features/` placement)
- **Structure**: Complete 6-folder system (1-requirements through 6-key_learnings)
- **Archive Planning**: Documentation preserved even if project receives NO-GO
- **Standards Reference**: Integration with `/docs/00_standards_and_practices/`

### Safety and Compliance Requirements
- **OPSCHECK**: Operational compliance check before each phase
- **Git Strategy**: Mandatory branch usage with incremental commits
- **Circuit Breaker**: 3+ failed attempts = automatic rollback consideration
- **Emergency Procedures**: User directive compliance ("NO STOP", "HALT WORK")
- **SSE Special Handling**: Any SSE changes require enhanced protocols

## Success Criteria

### AN-SOP Success Criteria (✅ Completed)
- [x] Complete system analysis across all 6 specified areas
- [x] Clear requirements definition for each potential implementation area
- [x] Risk assessment incorporating major-system-cleanup failure learnings
- [x] Feasibility study with mini-project structure planning
- [x] Testing strategy addressing regression prevention

### PLAN-SOP Success Criteria (Pending)
- [ ] Detailed architecture design for each approved mini-project
- [ ] Individual GO/NO-GO gate structure for each phase
- [ ] Implementation timeline with incremental commit strategy
- [ ] Safety controls and rollback procedures for each mini-project
- [ ] Testing requirements and validation procedures

### Overall Project Success Criteria (If Implemented)
- Simplified architecture while preserving ALL existing functionality
- Significantly streamlined debugging and troubleshooting
- Enhanced Development Practice and Project Management protocol enforcement
- Preserved contextual checkpoints for Claude and other agents
- Foundation prepared for future sse-simplification-and-cleanup project

## Constraints and Dependencies

### Hard Constraints
- **Functionality Preservation**: Zero tolerance for regression
- **Enhanced Protocols**: All APPLICATION-LEVEL SEV-0 procedures must be followed
- **Testing First**: No architectural changes without comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Incremental Approach**: Mini-project structure with individual validation

### Dependencies
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Must be implemented before architectural changes
- **Safety Controls**: All existing circuit breakers and emergency procedures maintained
- **Documentation**: Real-time updates and decision rationale required
- **Branch Strategy**: All work isolated in feature branch until validated

### Risk Mitigation Requirements
- **Major-System-Cleanup Learnings**: All failure analysis insights must be integrated
- **SSE Special Handling**: Any SSE-related work requires SEV-1 classification minimum
- **Cross-Tab Testing**: Real-time feature testing mandatory
- **User Experience**: No degradation in collaborative functionality

## Approval Gates

### AN-SOP → PLAN-SOP Gate (✅ Completed)
- **Status**: Analysis complete, risk assessment favorable
- **Recommendation**: GO for PLAN-SOP based on comprehensive analysis
- **Dependencies**: Enhanced protocols active, comprehensive analysis documented

### PLAN-SOP → DEV-SOP Gate (Pending)
- **Requirements**: Detailed implementation plan approved
- **Dependencies**: Mini-project architecture, safety controls, testing strategy
- **Criteria**: User approval of implementation approach and risk mitigation

### Individual Mini-Project Gates (Future)
