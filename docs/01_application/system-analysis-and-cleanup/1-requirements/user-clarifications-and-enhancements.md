# User Clarifications and Protocol Enhancements

**Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Project**: system-analysis-and-cleanup  
**Context**: User clarifications during project setup and OPSCHECK implementation

## Documentation Structure Corrections

### Initial Error and Correction
**Initial Placement**: Incorrectly placed project in `/docs/02_features/`  
**User Correction**: "STOP - APPLICATION LEVEL projects go in 01_application per our previous protocol enchancements"  
**Resolution**: Moved to `/docs/01_application/system-analysis-and-cleanup/`

### Standards Restructuring Requirements
**User Direction**: Move application standards to separate standards folder  
**Implementation**:
1. Created `/docs/00_standards_and_practices/`
2. Moved `development-standards.md`, `sev-classification.md`, `emergency-procedures.md`
3. Updated navigation and references throughout documentation

## APPLICATION-LEVEL Project Protocol Clarifications

### Question-Answer Session for Protocol Enhancement

#### Q1: Documentation Location Structure
**Question**: Should APPLICATION-LEVEL projects create subfolder in `/docs/01_application/`?  
**Answer**: "Yes."  
**Implementation**: Created `/docs/01_application/system-analysis-and-cleanup/`

#### Q2: Documentation Pattern for APPLICATION-LEVEL Work  
**Question**: Do APPLICATION-LEVEL projects use 6-folder structure?  
**Answer**: "Yes."  
**Implementation**: Complete 1-requirements through 6-key_learnings structure

#### Q3: Relationship to Existing Standards
**Question**: How do APPLICATION-LEVEL projects relate to existing files?  
**Answer**: "those files should likely be moved to a different folder like 00_standards_and_practices"  
**Implementation**: Restructured entire documentation hierarchy

#### Q4: Archive Handling for APPLICATION-LEVEL
**Question**: If APPLICATION-LEVEL project fails, does it go to `/docs/06_archive/`?  
**Answer**: "Yes."  
**Implementation**: Archive procedures apply to APPLICATION-LEVEL projects

#### Q5: SEV-0 APPLICATION-LEVEL Protocol Clarification
**Question**: Special procedures for APPLICATION-LEVEL SEV-0 projects?  
**Answer**: "yes- APPLICATION LEVEL PROJECTS should treat each DEV-SOP phase as a 'mini-project' within the larger group in terms of testing/documentation and commit-to-the-branch checkpoints"

#### Q6: Mini-Project Phase Management
**Question**: Enhanced protocols for phase management?  
**Answer**: "yes - each DEV-SOP phase (area or domain of implementation) has it's own check point of Go/No-Go. This makes it important to carefully consider how each phase of DEV-SOP should be chunked so they can be committed incrementally and keep the application in a good, clean state."

## Enhanced Protocol Requirements

### Mini-Project Structure
**Key Insight**: APPLICATION-LEVEL projects require more granular control than FEATURE-LEVEL projects

**Requirements**:
- Each DEV-SOP phase treated as independent mini-project
- Individual testing and documentation per mini-project
- Commit-to-branch checkpoints after each mini-project completion
- Individual GO/NO-GO gates for each implementation area

### Clean State Maintenance
**Critical Requirement**: Application must remain in clean, functional state throughout implementation

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Careful chunking of DEV-SOP phases
- Incremental commits preserving functionality
- Individual rollback capability per mini-project
- Continuous integration testing

## OPSCHECK Protocol Development

### Protocol Violation Detection
**Issue**: Started AN-SOP without creating mandatory git branch  
**User Question**: "did we create branch prior to ANSOP?"  
**Response**: Immediate protocol violation acknowledgment and correction

### OPSCHECK Creation
**User Direction**: "verify all other APPLICATION level-1 sev-0 protocols are in compliance remember this active as OPSCHECK going forward - update all documentation and memory instructions with new term and checklist"

**New Protocol Established**: **OPSCHECK** (Operational Compliance Check)
- **Definition**: Comprehensive verification of all required protocols before phase work
- **Application**: Mandatory for all APPLICATION LEVEL-1 SEV-0 projects
- **Integration**: Added to all relevant documentation and memory instructions
- **Authority**: Based on major-system-cleanup failure analysis learnings

## Git Strategy Clarifications

### Branch Creation Protocol
**Requirement**: Mandatory git branch for APPLICATION-LEVEL SEV-0 projects  
**Implementation**: Created `feature/system-analysis-and-cleanup` branch  
**Compliance**: All work isolated in branch until validation complete

### Commit Strategy
**Enhancement**: Incremental commits after each mini-project phase  
**Benefit**: Individual rollback capability, progress preservation  
**Integration**: Commit checkpoints align with GO/NO-GO gates

## Memory Instruction Updates

### New Protocol Integration
**OPSCHECK**: Added as mandatory step for APPLICATION-LEVEL work
- Before AN-SOP, PLAN-SOP, DEV-SOP phases
- Before each mini-project within DEV-SOP
- After emergency halt situations
- When Claude/agents reconnect to ongoing project

### Documentation Standards
**Enhanced Requirements**:
- Real-time documentation updates during all phases
- Decision rationale capture for all architectural decisions
- Agent-specific guidance for complex integration points
- Contextual checkpoints for session disconnect scenarios

## Protocol Effectiveness Validation

### OPSCHECK Success
**Verification**: Complete protocol compliance achieved after OPSCHECK implementation
- Git strategy compliant
- Documentation structure corrected  
- Classification and safety protocols active
- Enhanced APPLICATION-LEVEL procedures implemented

### Learning Integration
**Major-System-Cleanup Lessons**: All failure analysis insights integrated into enhanced protocols
- Circuit breaker development (3+ failed attempts = rollback consideration)
- User directive compliance ("NO STOP", "HALT WORK")
- SSE special handling (SEV-1 minimum classification)
- Functionality preservation over architectural idealism

## User Approval and Direction

### Final Authorization
**User Command**: "commit all current docs to branch; then go for ANSOP"  
**Status**: Documentation committed, AN-SOP authorized and completed

**Follow-up Command**: "document current work progress ANSOP findings summary in branch commit to branch to preserve context date once done, go for PLANSOP"  
**Status**: Complete analysis documented and committed, PLAN-SOP authorized
