## Final Assessment

**Mini-Project 1**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Mission Status**: **ACCOMPLISHED** ✅  
**Quality**: **HIGH** - Core infrastructure fully validated  
**Risk**: **LOW** - Comprehensive testing prevents regression  
**Readiness**: **READY** for Mini-Project 2

**Key Achievement**: Successfully created the missing SSE testing infrastructure that was identified as a critical gap in our AN-SOP analysis. This infrastructure would have caught the major-system-cleanup failure and prevented the regression that required project rollback.
