# Data & Event Flow Architecture - Human Readable

## Overview
This document describes how data flows through the Conversation Tracker application and how events are propagated across different layers.

## Core Data Flow Patterns

### 1. User Session Management
```
Browser → GlobalSessionProvider → Session API → Session Store
   ↓
User Actions → Session Events → Event Tracking → Analytics
```

**Description:**
- All user interactions are tracked through a centralized session system
- Each user gets a unique session ID that persists across page reloads
- Session data includes user preferences, activity timestamps, and interaction patterns

### 2. Card Data Lifecycle
```
User Input → Card Dialog → Card API → Database
     ↓
Card CRUD Operations → React Query Cache → UI Updates
     ↓
Event Emission → Conversation Logs → Session Tracking
```

**Key Components:**
- **Card Creation**: New cards go through validation, get assigned IDs, and are persisted
- **Card Updates**: Content changes, zone moves, and assignments trigger cache invalidation
- **Card Deletion**: Removes from database and clears all related cache entries

### 3. Real-Time Event Propagation
```
User Action → Event Emitter → Multiple Subscribers:
    ├── Session Tracking
    ├── Conversation Logging  
    ├── UI State Updates
    └── Performance Monitoring
```

**Event Types:**
- **UI Events**: Dialog opens, menu interactions, theme changes
- **Card Events**: Create, update, move, delete operations
- **Preference Events**: Animation settings, theme changes
- **System Events**: Performance warnings, error conditions

### 4. Theme & UI State Management
```
User Preference → Theme Provider → Dynamic Theme Context
      ↓
Component Re-renders → CSS Class Updates → Visual Changes
      ↓
Preference Persistence → User API → Database Storage
```

**Theme Flow:**
- User selects theme → Context updates → All components receive new theme classes
- Theme preferences are saved to user profile for persistence
- Guest users get temporary theme storage that resets on session end

### 5. React Query Data Management
```
Component Mount → useQuery Hook → Cache Check:
    ├── Cache Hit → Return Cached Data
    └── Cache Miss → Fetch from API → Update Cache → Return Data
              ↓
Background Refetch → Cache Updates → Component Re-renders
```

**Cache Strategy:**
- **Cards**: 30-second stale time, background refetch enabled
- **Users**: 5-minute stale time, rarely changes
- **Sessions**: 1-minute stale time, frequent updates expected

## API Request Patterns

### Typical Request Flow
```
Frontend Component → React Query Hook → HTTP Request → Next.js API Route → Database
         ↓
Response Processing → Cache Update → UI State Update → Event Emission
```

### Common API Endpoints
- `GET /api/cards` - Fetch all cards with caching
- `POST /api/cards` - Create new card, invalidate cache
- `PATCH /api/cards/[id]` - Update card, selective cache invalidation
- `DELETE /api/cards/[id]` - Remove card, full cache clear
- `GET /api/users` - User management with long cache
- `POST /api/sessions/events` - Event tracking (no cache)

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Error Propagation
```
API Error → React Query Error → Component Error Boundary → User Notification
     ↓
Fallback UI → Manual Retry → Background Recovery → Normal Operation
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
API Response Time → Performance Tracker → Circuit Breaker Check:
    ├── Normal → Continue Operations
    └── Degraded → Enable Performance Mode → Reduce Features
```

## Security & Data Protection

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login → JWT Token → Request Headers → API Validation → Database Access
     ↓
Session Creation → Cookie Storage → Automatic Refresh → Secure Persistence
```

### Guest User Handling
```
Guest Access → Temporary Session → Limited Permissions → Automatic Cleanup
     ↓
30-minute timeout → Session Expiry → Data Purge → Fresh Guest Option
```

## Real-Time SSE Implementation ✅ ACTIVE

### Multi-Tab SSE Architecture
```
Component → useSSECardEvents Hook → SSE Connection → Real-time Events → Direct State Updates
     ↓                                    ↓                             ↓
Hook Registry → Multi-Tab Coordination → 800ms Polling → Background Updates
     ↓
React Query Fallback (if SSE fails) → Graceful Degradation → Normal Operation
```

**Active SSE Event Types:**
- `card.created` - New card added by any user ✅
- `card.updated` - Content or position changes ✅
- `card.moved` - Zone transitions ✅
- `card.deleted` - Card removal events ✅
- `card.flipped` - Front/back state changes ✅

### SSE Multi-Tab Coordination
```
Tab 1: useSSECardEvents → Hook Registry → SSE Connection A
Tab 2: useSSECardEvents → Hook Registry → SSE Connection B
     ↓                        ↓                ↓
Independent Connections → Shared Event Stream → Synchronized UI Updates
```

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Updates**: <1 second cross-tab synchronization
- **Multi-Tab Support**: Unlimited concurrent browser tabs
- **Background Operation**: Updates work in inactive tabs
- **Graceful Fallback**: React Query backup if SSE fails

## Performance Characteristics

### Load Times (Observed)
- Initial Page Load: ~800ms
- Card API Response: ~45ms average
- Cache Hit Response: ~2ms
- Theme Switch: ~100ms

### Memory Usage
- React Query Cache: ~2-5MB typical
- Component Tree: ~1-3MB
- Session Data: ~100KB per user

### Optimization Strategies
- React Query reduces API calls by 85%
- Component memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Dynamic imports reduce initial bundle size
- Image optimization for profile pictures
