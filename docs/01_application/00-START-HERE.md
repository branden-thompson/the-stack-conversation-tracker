## Key Application Concepts

### Real-Time Architecture
This application heavily relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time cross-tab synchronization. Any changes to SSE infrastructure should be treated as **application-level architecture changes** requiring appropriate classification and safety protocols.

### Theme System  
The application uses a sophisticated theme system with both light/dark mode and color theme variations. All UI components must be theme-aware using the established theme constants.

### User Management
Unified user management system handles both registered users and guest users with comprehensive preference management and session tracking.

### Development Safety
Multiple safety systems are in place including circuit breakers, performance monitoring, emergency rollback procedures, and development server management scripts.

**Important**: Application-level documentation changes should be carefully reviewed as they affect project-wide standards and practices that all feature development must follow.
