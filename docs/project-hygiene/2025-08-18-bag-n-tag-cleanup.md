# Bag n Tag Cleanup - React Query Migration
*Date: 2025-08-18*

## Summary
Completed "Bag n Tag" cleanup process after successful React Query migration. All legacy hooks have been moved to deprecated folders and gitignored while maintaining fallback capability.

## What Was Done

### 1. Legacy Hook Migration
Moved legacy implementations to `/lib/hooks/deprecated/`:
- `useConversationsLegacy.js` - Original conversations hook
- `useCardsLegacy.js` - Original cards hook  
- `useUsersLegacy.js` - Original users hook
- `useUserTrackingLegacy.js` - Original user tracking hook

### 2. Main Hook Files Cleaned
Simplified main hook files to only contain migration wrappers:
- `useConversations.js` - Now only contains React Query/legacy switch
- `useCards.js` - Now only contains React Query/legacy switch
- `useUsers.js` - Now only contains React Query/legacy switch + React Query implementation
- `useUserTracking.js` - Now only contains React Query/legacy switch

### 3. Project Configuration Updates
- Added `**/deprecated/` to `.gitignore` to exclude deprecated code from version control
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with "Bag n Tag" process documentation
- Added recent work entries for React Query migration and Bag n Tag cleanup

### 4. Restoration Capability
All deprecated files include headers with:
- Move date and reason
- Clear restoration instructions
- Files can be restored by moving them out of `/deprecated` folders

## Benefits

### Code Organization
- ✅ Clean main hook files with clear migration pattern
- ✅ Legacy code preserved but separated
- ✅ Easy restoration path if rollback needed

### Version Control
- ✅ Deprecated code excluded from git tracking
- ✅ Cleaner commit history going forward
- ✅ Reduced repository size

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Clear migration boundaries
- ✅ Safety switch pattern maintained
- ✅ Documentation for future reference

## File Structure After Cleanup

```
lib/hooks/
├── deprecated/               # Gitignored deprecated code
│   ├── useCardsLegacy.js
│   ├── useConversationsLegacy.js  
│   ├── useUsersLegacy.js
│   └── useUserTrackingLegacy.js
├── useCards.js              # Clean migration wrapper
├── useCardsQuery.js         # React Query implementation
├── useConversations.js      # Clean migration wrapper
├── useConversationsQuery.js # React Query implementation
├── useUsers.js              # Clean migration wrapper + RQ impl
├── useUserTracking.js       # Clean migration wrapper
└── useUserTrackingQuery.js  # React Query implementation
```

## Process Documentation
The "Bag n Tag" process has been documented in `CLAUDE.md` for future use. This terminology can be used for any successful migration cleanup going forward.

## Safety Notes
- Legacy code remains available for restoration
- Safety switches still functional for instant rollback
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Migration can be reversed by moving files out of `/deprecated`
