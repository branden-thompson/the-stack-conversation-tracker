# Navigation Label Clarification

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Objective
Update left tray navigation labels to better reflect the actual functionality and avoid confusion between different tracking systems.

## Problem
- **Before**: "Event Tracking" link pointed to `/dev/convos` (card/conversation events)
- **Confusion**: We now have comprehensive user event tracking in `/dev/user-tracking`
- **Ambiguity**: "Event Tracking" could refer to either card events or user events

## Solution
Updated navigation label to be more specific about what it tracks.

## Changes Made

### `/components/ui/left-tray.jsx`
**Before:**
```javascript
<MessageSquare className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
Event Tracking
```

**After:**
```javascript
<MessageSquare className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
Card Tracking
```

## Navigation Clarity Achieved

### Left Tray Developer Navigation:
- **"Card Tracking"** → `/dev/convos` 
  - Tracks conversation and card-specific events
  - Monitors card creation, updates, moves, deletions
  - Event timeline for conversation flow

- **"User Tracking"** → `/dev/user-tracking`
  - Tracks user sessions and activity
  - Monitors user behavior across the application
  - Real-time session management and analytics

## Benefits
1. **Clear Distinction**: No ambiguity about which tracking system
2. **Accurate Labeling**: Label matches the actual functionality
3. **Better UX**: Developers know exactly what they're accessing
4. **Semantic Clarity**: "Card" events vs "User" events are distinct

## Consistency Note
The change maintains consistency with the existing "User Tracking" label and creates a logical pairing of tracking systems.
