# Card Border Corner Clipping Issue

## Problem Description

When using `rounded-xl` corners on card components with `border-2` styling, border edges were extending slightly beyond the rounded corner radius, creating visible "clipping" artifacts - particularly noticeable in the bottom-right corners of card backs.

**Visual Symptoms:**
- Border lines extending past rounded corners
- Most visible in bottom-right corner areas
- Occurred on CardBack components during flip animation
- Persisted despite browser refresh and server restart

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Investigation (Incorrect Assumptions)
1. **First Assumption**: Corner decorations in CardBack component
   - Removed corner decoration elements entirely
   - Issue persisted - ruled out CardBack as source

2. **Second Assumption**: Child elements extending beyond container
   - Added `overflow-hidden` to CardBack container
   - Added `rounded-xl` to all child elements
   - Issue persisted - ruled out content overflow

### Debugging Process
Used temporary debug border to isolate the issue:
```javascript
style={{
  border: '3px solid red', // DEBUG: Temporary border to see container boundaries
}}
```

**Key Discovery**: The debug border revealed that:
- CardBack content was properly contained within rounded corners
- Corner clipping artifacts appeared **outside** the CardBack container boundaries
- This proved the issue was coming from a parent container

### Actual Root Cause
The issue was in **FlippableCard.jsx** at the 3D flip container level:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
<div 
  className={cn(
    'relative rounded-xl border-2 shadow-sm',  // ← Missing overflow-hidden
    typeColors?.container
  )}
  style={{
    transformStyle: 'preserve-3d',
    transform: showingFace ? 'rotateY(0deg)' : 'rotateY(180deg)',
    // ... other styles
  }}
>
```

**The Problem:**
- `border-2` class creates a 2px border
- `rounded-xl` applies border-radius to container
- In some browser rendering scenarios, the border pixels extend slightly beyond the rounded corner radius
- Without `overflow-hidden`, these border edge pixels are visible
- The `typeColors?.container` classes provide border colors (e.g., `border-blue-400`) making the clipped edges visible

## Solution

Add `overflow-hidden` to the FlippableCard's 3D flip container:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
<div 
  className={cn(
    'relative rounded-xl border-2 shadow-sm overflow-hidden',  // ← Added overflow-hidden
    typeColors?.container
  )}
  style={{
    transformStyle: 'preserve-3d',
    transform: showingFace ? 'rotateY(0deg)' : 'rotateY(180deg)',
    // ... other styles
  }}
>
```

**Location**: `/components/conversation-board/FlippableCard.jsx:250`

## Why This Was Difficult to Debug

1. **Nested Component Structure**: 
   - Issue appeared on CardBack but originated in FlippableCard
   - Multiple layers of containers with different styling responsibilities

2. **Browser Rendering Subtlety**:
   - Border pixel rendering can vary slightly across browsers
   - The clipping was subtle but visually noticeable
   - Not consistently reproducible in all browser configurations

3. **3D Transform Context**:
   - The issue occurred within a 3D CSS transform context (`preserve-3d`)
   - Transform rendering can affect how borders are rasterized
   - The problem was only visible during specific transform states

4. **Component Hierarchy Confusion**:
   - CardBack is rendered inside FlippableCard
   - Visual issue appeared on CardBack but source was in parent
   - Required understanding of the complete render tree

## Browser Compatibility Notes

This issue is related to how browsers handle:
- Border rendering with `border-radius`
- Pixel-level precision in CSS transforms
- Border anti-aliasing in 3D transform contexts

**Affected Scenarios:**
- Cards with `border-2` + `rounded-xl`
- 3D CSS transforms (`preserve-3d`, `rotateY`)
- High DPI displays where sub-pixel rendering is more noticeable

## Prevention Guidelines

When creating components with rounded borders:

1. **Always pair `rounded-*` with `overflow-hidden`** when using borders:
   ```css
   .rounded-border-container {
     @apply rounded-xl border-2 overflow-hidden;
   }
   ```

2. **Test on multiple browsers and DPI settings**:
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Standard and high DPI displays
   - Different zoom levels

3. **Use debug borders to isolate container boundaries**:
   ```javascript
   style={{ border: '2px solid red' }} // Temporary debugging
   ```

4. **Check parent containers** when visual issues appear on child components

## Related Issues

This fix resolves:
- Corner clipping on all card types (TOPIC, FACT, QUESTION, ACCUSATION, etc.)
- Visual artifacts during card flip animations
- Border rendering inconsistencies across browsers

## Testing Verification

After applying the fix:
1. ✅ All card corners properly rounded
2. ✅ No border clipping on any card type
3. ✅ Consistent rendering across browser refresh
4. ✅ Clean visual appearance during flip animations
5. ✅ Fixed in both light and dark themes
