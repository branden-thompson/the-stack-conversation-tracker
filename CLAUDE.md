## Important Project Information

### Docker Setup
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Docker files are located in the `/docker` directory, NOT in the root:
- `/docker/dockerfile` - Main Dockerfile for the application
- `/docker/docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration
- `/docker/README.md` - Docker setup documentation

Do NOT create Docker files in the project root - they already exist in `/docker/`.

### Project Structure
- Next.js 15 application with App Router
- Standalone output mode enabled for Docker deployment
- Main application on port 3000 (3001 when using docker-compose)

### Key Directories
- `/app` - Next.js app directory (pages and API routes)
- `/components` - React components
- `/lib` - Utilities, hooks, and services
- `/data` - Static data files
- `/dev-scripts` - Development and testing scripts
- `/docker` - Docker configuration files
- `/docs` - Project documentation
  - `/docs/project-hygiene/` - **IMPORTANT**: All cleanup and hygiene summaries go here
  - `/docs/features/` - Feature documentation

### Testing Commands
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linter
- `npm run build` - Build for production

### Recent Work Completed
1. Consolidated user management system (unified `useUserManagement` hook)
2. Expanded guest name/avatar system (552x increase in combinations)
3. Fixed dev-header user selector dropdown consistency
4. Cleaned up console.log statements (66% reduction)
5. Fixed Next.js 15 async params/cookies warnings
6. Fixed build errors in /dev/tests page
7. Enhanced SessionCard styling with proper visual hierarchy (2025-08-18)
8. Added card background colors to UI theme constants (2025-08-18)
9. **React Query Migration** - Successfully migrated all hooks to React Query with safety switches (2025-08-18)
10. **Bag n Tag Cleanup** - Deprecated legacy hooks after successful React Query migration (2025-08-18)
11. **Synthwave84 Theme** - Implemented custom dark-mode exclusive retro-futuristic theme (2025-08-18)
12. **User Theme Mode Isolation** - MINOR SEV-0 feature completed with per-user theme storage (2025-08-21)
13. **BRTOPS Framework Development** - MAJOR SEV-0 system created and deployed to GitHub (2025-08-21)

### Development Notes  
**üéñÔ∏è BRTOPS PRIORITY**: When BRTOPS commands are used, they supersede all legacy terminology and workflows

- NEVER NEVER NEVER add unprompted features unless you specifically ask to create them
- When making changes, always check if files already exist before creating new ones
- Use the existing project structure and conventions
- Docker configuration is already set up in `/docker/` directory
- The project uses a unified user management system for both app and dev pages
- **Legacy Override**: "AN-SOP" ‚Üí "GO RCC", "PLAN-SOP" ‚Üí "GO PLAN", "DEV-SOP" ‚Üí "GO CODE", "PDSOP" ‚Üí "GO FINAL"
- **Theme System**: Always use theme constants from `/lib/utils/ui-constants.js`
  - `THEME.colors.background.card` for card backgrounds in dev pages
  - `APP_THEME.colors.background.card` for card backgrounds in main app
  - Never hardcode colors directly in components
- **CSS Values**: Avoid CSS calc() functions when possible - use direct rem/px values instead
  - ‚ùå Bad: `'calc(1rem - 4px)'` (expensive calculation)
  - ‚úÖ Good: `'0.75rem'` (direct value, since 1rem = 16px, 0.75rem = 12px)
  - Calculations are expensive and should only be used when absolutely necessary

### Dev-Scripts Web Interface
**üé® Professional Development Tools Dashboard**
- **Access URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dev-scripts/` (development only)
- **Security**: Automatically blocked in production builds and Docker containers
- **Features**: Interactive testing, visual results viewer, mobile responsive
- **Framework**: Zero-dependency CSS with VS Code-inspired dark theme

**üìç Quick Access:**
- Master Dashboard: `/dev-scripts/`
- Guest Avatar Testing: `/dev-scripts/test-pages/test-guest-avatar-live.html`
- Results Viewer: `/dev-scripts/results/`
- Generated Galleries: Run `node dev-scripts/tests/api/test-guest-avatars.js`

**üîí Security Configuration:**
- Development: All dev-scripts accessible via Next.js API route
- Production: Middleware and API route return 404 (tools completely hidden)
- Docker: Automatically disabled in container environments
- Test Access: `node dev-scripts/test-access.js`

### Documentation Guidelines
**üìÅ Project Hygiene Documentation**
- **ALWAYS** save cleanup summaries in `/docs/project-hygiene/`
- Use descriptive filenames with dates (e.g., `2025-08-18-build-cleanup.md`)
- Include before/after metrics when doing cleanup work
- Document all linting, build fixes, and optimization work in this folder
- This keeps cleanup work organized and trackable over time

### "BAG TAG" Process (BRTOPS Command)
**üè∑Ô∏è Post-Success Legacy Code Cleanup**
When a major migration or refactor is successfully completed, use the "BAG TAG" process:

**BRTOPS Command**: `BAG TAG [target]` - Execute legacy code cleanup

1. **Determine** if legacy code is still needed after the successful implementation
2. **Create** `/deprecated` folders in appropriate directories (e.g., `hooks/deprecated`)
3. **Move** legacy code to deprecated folders with proper headers:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * DEPRECATED: Legacy [ComponentName]
    * 
    * MOVED: [Date]
    * REASON: [Migration completed successfully]
    * RESTORE: Move back to parent directory if [condition] needs rollback
    */
   ```
4. **Clean up** main files to only contain migration wrappers
5. **Add** `**/deprecated/` to `.gitignore` once successfully deprecated
6. **Document** the process in project hygiene docs
7. **Remember**: Files can be restored by moving them out of `/deprecated` folders if needed

**BRTOPS Terminology**: Use "BAG TAG" command. Legacy terms ("Bag n Tag", "Bag and Tag", "Bag-n-Tag") are superseded by BRTOPS.

### Custom Theme Implementation
**üé® Adding New Color Themes**
When implementing custom themes, follow this established pattern:

1. **Create theme file** in `/lib/themes/color-themes/[theme-name].js`
2. **Follow mathematical color generation** - use existing theme ratios for consistency
3. **Add import and registration** in `/lib/themes/theme-loader.js`
4. **Update color previews** in `/components/ui/color-theme-selector.jsx`
5. **Consider dark-only themes** with `darkOnly: true` flag for specialized aesthetics
6. **Test across all theme-aware components** to ensure universal coverage
7. **Document in project hygiene** for implementation tracking

**Example: Synthwave84 Theme (2025-08-18)**
- Dark-mode exclusive retro-futuristic theme
- Base colors: Blue-Purple backgrounds, Hot-Pink borders, Hot Teal text
- Balanced approach: Maintains readability while preserving aesthetic
- Universal application: All theme-aware elements styled consistently
